# Seeds run in-container because the database is only reachable on Railway's
# private network, and both are idempotent — the tenant seed skips an existing
# tenant and backfills nothing on a second run, and the methodology seed skips
# codes already present. A seed failure must not stop the service from
# starting: the service is still useful, and the failure is visible in logs.
